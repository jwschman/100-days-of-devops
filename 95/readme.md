# Day 95

## Task

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

Use Terraform to create a security group under the default VPC with the following requirements:

1) The name of the security group must be xfusion-sg.

2) The description must be Security group for Nautilus App Servers.

3) Add an inbound rule of type HTTP, with a port range of 80, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.

4) Add another inbound rule of type SSH, with a port range of 22, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.

Ensure that the security group is created in the us-east-1 region using Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

## Solution

So we want to use the default vpc.  We could just leave the vpc blank, but I'd rather be more explicit here to satisfy the task, so we're going to create a data block containing the dfault vpc and use that.

So first create `main.tf` and add:

```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

resource "aws_security_group" "xfusion_sg" {
  name        = "xfusion-sg"
  description = "Security group for Nautilus App Servers"
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.default.id

  ingress {
    description = "http tcp port"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "ssh tcp port"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

}
```

Then we just terraform it:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Validation

Confirm Terraform created it:

```bash
terraform state list
terraform show
```

We should see `aws_security_group.xfusion_sg` in the state with both ingress rules.

## Insights

So I'm actually certified in Terraform and this is pretty simple.  Just check the documentation and use the arguments that the task requires.  Pretty easy stuff so far.
