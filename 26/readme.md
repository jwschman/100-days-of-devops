# Day 26

## Task

The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/games.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games repo add a new remote dev_games and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_games.git repository.

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

## Solution

ssh into the storage server and:

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
git add remote add dev_games /opt/xfusioncorp_games.git
cp /tmp/index.html .
git add .
git commit -m "add index.html"
git push dev_games master
```

## Validation

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## Insights

Origins can be kind of confusing, but once you understand that they are just pointers to other repositories it becomes easier to understand.

The biggest thing to remember for this task was to push to the new remote, not the old one.
